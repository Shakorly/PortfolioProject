# PortfolioProject

There are two parts to this project:
1.using SQL, explore and query the dataset.
2.Data visualization with Tableau...I begin by inserting the dataset and studying it; a lot of business questions are answered, such as:
1.Which states or countries our customers order from, and which products they purchase.
2.Why are our profits so low in 2005?How much did we make in total in 2003 and 2004?
